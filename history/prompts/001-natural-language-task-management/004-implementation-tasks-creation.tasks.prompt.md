# sp.tasks.md

## Task Breakdown

### T1-T24: Complete task breakdown including:
- Database Models (Conversation, Message, Task)
- Conversation Utilities (create, get, add_message, get_history)
- MCP Tools (add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task)
- MCP Server setup
- System Prompt and OpenAI Agent Class (using Gemini API)
- Chat API Endpoint
- Tailwind Config and Base UI Components
- Chat Components (Header, Bubble, List, Input)
- Chat Page integration
- API Client
- Integration Testing
- Frontend/Backend Deployment (Vercel/Render)
- E2E Testing
- Documentation
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive tasks.md with 68 tasks organized into 6 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)**
- Project structure, backend/frontend initialization, linting config

**Phase 2: Foundation (T006-T016)**
- Database connection, Conversation/Message/Task models
- Alembic migrations, conversation utilities, task service

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - MVP (T017-T043)**
- 5 MCP tools (add, list, complete, delete, update)
- MCP Server with tool registration
- TaskMasterAgent with Gemini API
- POST /api/{user_id}/chat endpoint
- Tailwind/shadcn setup, base UI components
- Chat components (Header, Bubble, List, Input)
- Chat page with state management

**Phase 4: User Stories 2-6 (T044-T049)**
- Integration tests for all task operations
- Multi-turn conversation testing

**Phase 5: Deployment (T050-T063)**
- Backend to Render, Frontend to Vercel
- Environment variables, CORS config
- E2E verification (chat, tasks, persistence, mobile, dark mode)

**Phase 6: Polish (T064-T068)**
- README, API docs, .env.example, cleanup

**Key Features:**
- Tasks organized by user story for independent testing
- [P] markers for parallel execution opportunities
- Exact file paths from plan.md
- Critical path and dependency graph included

## Outcome

- Impact: Complete implementation roadmap with 68 actionable tasks
- Tests: Integration tests defined in T044-T049
- Files: 1 file created (specs/001-natural-language-task-management/tasks.md)
- Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin execution, or start with T001 manually
- Reflection: Noted Gemini API usage per user input T10 (not OpenAI as originally in constitution)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: User input mentioned both "OpenAI Agent" and "Gemini API" - used Gemini as specified in T10
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual validation PASS - all 24 user tasks mapped to detailed subtasks
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - tasks established successfully
