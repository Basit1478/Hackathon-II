# Feature Specification: Natural Language Task Management

**Feature Branch**: `001-natural-language-task-management`
**Created**: 2026-01-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: Chat interface, MCP tools, AI agent for TaskMaster Pro AI Phase III

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Send a Message and Receive AI Response (Priority: P1)

A user opens the chat interface and sends a message. The system processes the message through the AI agent and returns a response. This establishes the core chat loop without requiring task operations.

**Why this priority**: This is the fundamental interaction pattern. Without a working chat loop, no other features can be demonstrated or tested.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending "Hello" and receiving a friendly response from TaskMaster AI. Delivers immediate value as proof of AI integration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chat interface is loaded, **When** user types "Hello" and clicks Send, **Then** an AI response appears within 3 seconds
2. **Given** a conversation exists, **When** user sends another message, **Then** it appends to the same conversation with updated timestamps
3. **Given** the user reloads the page, **When** they return to the chat, **Then** previous messages are displayed (conversation persistence)

---

### User Story 2 - Add a Task via Natural Language (Priority: P2)

A user types a natural language command to add a task. The AI agent interprets the intent, invokes the `add_task` MCP tool, and confirms the task was created.

**Why this priority**: Adding tasks is the primary write operation. Once users can add tasks, they have a usable todo system.

**Independent Test**: Type "Add buy groceries to my list" and verify the task appears in the database and AI confirms creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the chat is ready, **When** user types "Add buy groceries", **Then** AI responds with confirmation including the task title
2. **Given** user adds a task with description "Add call mom - need to discuss weekend plans", **When** processed, **Then** task is created with title "Call mom" and description stored
3. **Given** user types "add", **When** no task title provided, **Then** AI asks for clarification about what to add

---

### User Story 3 - List Tasks via Natural Language (Priority: P3)

A user asks to see their tasks. The AI agent invokes `list_tasks` and presents the tasks in a readable format.

**Why this priority**: Viewing tasks is essential but depends on having tasks to view. Slightly lower priority than adding.

**Independent Test**: After adding tasks, type "Show my tasks" and verify all tasks are listed with their statuses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has 3 tasks, **When** user types "Show my tasks", **Then** AI lists all 3 tasks with IDs and statuses
2. **Given** user has pending and completed tasks, **When** user types "Show pending tasks", **Then** only pending tasks are listed
3. **Given** user has no tasks, **When** user types "List tasks", **Then** AI responds with "You don't have any tasks yet"

---

### User Story 4 - Complete a Task via Natural Language (Priority: P4)

A user marks a task as complete by referencing it naturally. The AI invokes `complete_task` and confirms.

**Why this priority**: Completing tasks is the natural follow-up to adding them. Core to the todo workflow.

**Independent Test**: Given a task exists, type "Mark task 1 as done" and verify status changes to completed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** task ID 5 exists and is pending, **When** user types "Complete task 5", **Then** task status becomes "completed" and AI confirms
2. **Given** user types "I finished buying groceries", **When** a task titled "Buy groceries" exists, **Then** AI asks for confirmation before completing
3. **Given** user references non-existent task ID, **When** attempting completion, **Then** AI responds with "I couldn't find that task"

---

### User Story 5 - Delete a Task via Natural Language (Priority: P5)

A user removes a task they no longer need. The AI invokes `delete_task` and confirms removal.

**Why this priority**: Delete is a secondary operation, less common than add/complete. Important for cleanup.

**Independent Test**: Given a task exists, type "Delete task 2" and verify it is removed from the database.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** task ID 2 exists, **When** user types "Delete task 2", **Then** task is removed and AI confirms with task title
2. **Given** user types "Remove all completed tasks", **When** multiple completed tasks exist, **Then** AI asks for confirmation before bulk delete
3. **Given** user tries to delete non-existent task, **When** processed, **Then** AI responds with "That task doesn't exist"

---

### User Story 6 - Update a Task via Natural Language (Priority: P6)

A user modifies an existing task's title or description. The AI invokes `update_task` and confirms the change.

**Why this priority**: Updates are the least common operation. Users typically add, complete, or delete rather than edit.

**Independent Test**: Given a task exists, type "Rename task 1 to Buy milk" and verify the title changes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** task ID 1 has title "Buy groceries", **When** user types "Change task 1 to Buy milk", **Then** title updates to "Buy milk" and AI confirms
2. **Given** user types "Add a note to task 3: remember to check expiry dates", **When** processed, **Then** description is updated
3. **Given** user types vague update like "change my task", **When** multiple tasks exist, **Then** AI asks which task to update

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user sends an empty message? → AI prompts user to type something
- What happens when the API times out? → UI shows error message, message remains in input for retry
- What happens when user sends very long messages (>10,000 chars)? → Message is truncated with warning
- How does system handle concurrent requests from same user? → Requests are queued and processed sequentially per conversation
- What happens when database connection fails? → AI responds with "I'm having trouble right now, please try again"
- What happens when user references task by name that matches multiple tasks? → AI lists matching tasks and asks user to specify by ID

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-008**: System MUST create new conversation if `conversation_id` not provided
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate user_id and reject requests for invalid users

- **FR-014**: System MUST implement `update_task` tool accepting `{ user_id, task_id, title?, description? }` returning `{ task_id, status }`

**AI Agent:**

### Key Entities

- **Conversation**: Represents a chat session. Attributes: id, user_id, created_at, updated_at. Each user can have multiple conversations.
- **Message**: A single message in a conversation. Attributes: id, conversation_id, user_id, role (user/assistant), content, created_at. Belongs to one conversation.
- **Task**: A todo item. Attributes: id, user_id, title, description (optional), status (pending/completed), created_at, updated_at. Belongs to one user.
